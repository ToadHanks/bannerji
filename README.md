Project Description

A micro-mini R package to transform & plot a user traits to their emoji-equivalent values.
You can use this to make emoji traits banner that is personal to you. Useless, but still worth 10 secs. of your time.

*Initial emoji library is provided by [Muan](https://github.com/muan/emojilib)*
*not worthy of CRAN, believe me.*
