Note
--------
Emoji rendering is not possible at the moment in Windows OS due to Windows NT/OS-2 UTF-8 encoding issues. Ignore the ````r "Rtools required to build packages..."```` warning, if it occurs. It occurs randomly on various machines due to several dependencies of this package.

Project Description
--------------------
A micro-mini R package to transform & plot a user traits to their emoji-equivalent values.
You can use this to make emoji traits banner that is personal to you. Useless, but still worth 10 secs. of your time.

*Documentation and more details are in .tar files*          
*Initial emoji library was provided by [Muan](https://github.com/muan/emojilib)*   
*Not worthy of CRAN, believe me.*
